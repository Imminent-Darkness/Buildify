## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Buildify? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, the number of comments is a reasonable proxy for the impact a given change will have.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Buildify's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Buildify
- Enable a sustainable system for Buildify's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. Follow the styleguides
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Styleguide

All Python must adhere to PEP 8.
